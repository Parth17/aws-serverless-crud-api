# Serverless Framework API to Create CRUD APIs in AWS

Build a Serverless Framework API with AWS AppSync which supports CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and use GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline, AWS CodePipeline, or Serverless Pro CI/CD.

You can take screenshots of the CI/CD setup and include them in the README.

The CI/CD should trigger a deployment based on a git push to the master branch which goes through and deploys the backend Serverless Framework API"# aws-serverless-crud-api"
